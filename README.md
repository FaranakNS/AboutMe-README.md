## About Me

I am a dog-loving, code-writing and an avid swimmer. There are plenty of things I don't understand or know about computer science... but zero things I am not willing to try and learn.

I started learning Python3 on my own during a dead-end job, fueled by the desire for a better future. This journey eventually led me to discover my love for coding, prompting me to apply for college.

### Insights about my journey:

- 🚀 I really enjoy backend coding.
- 🌐 I really enjoy frontend coding.
- 🐕 I have an adorable Shih Tzu puppy named Miloo.
- 💼 I worked on a four-month capstone project for the Vice President of United Way Alberta Capital Region, creating a custom social media app.
- 🔄 I developed a customized website for a local shop in Edmonton, Alberta.
- 🎨 I am actively learning UI/UX design to complement my React skillset.
